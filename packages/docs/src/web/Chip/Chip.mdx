# Chip

Chips are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action.

### Usage

Chips allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. Chips should appear dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements. Unlike buttons, which should be a consistent and familiar call to action, one that a user expects to appear as the same action in the same general area.

***

### Principles

***

#### Compact

Chips are compact components that represent discrete information.

#### Relevant

Chips should have a clear and helpful relationship to the content or task they represent.

#### Focused

Chips should make tasks easier to complete, or content easier to sort.
